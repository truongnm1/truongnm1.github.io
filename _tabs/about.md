# Hey handsome! :flushed:
Welcome to by blog, let's get to know each other.

My name is Truong and I have an IT background. I love doing research and deep diving into things, which are espescially related to cybersecurity. There are specific roles in which I'm looking forward to participate are malware analyst and SOC guy. 

I also love playing League of Legends where I've achieved a mad rank which is bronze. My other hobby is drawing cause I can draw.
